# The Found - A Maternal Health Project

Welcome! This project is a part of the [Mozilla Open Leaders 7](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) (OL7) program. This document, called a "Read Me" file, will provide more information about the project and ways that you can contribute to it.

## What's this all about?

As a public health technologist, I'm dedicated to mitigating barriers to maternal health that are informative, engaging, and empowering to the communities I serve. I've conducted maternal health outreach by developing infographics, writing blog posts, and conducting advocacy within communities. My goal is to create an open network of digital maternal health resources to allow communities to self-organize resources in order to develop their own maternal health initiatives.

## How can you help?

Please remember that YOU are the expert! We need your help in many ways: content development, feedback, documentation, and eventually software development.

The primary goal is to support women during one of the most vulnerable times of their lives by engaging and sharing information. If you are looking to learn more about open source projects, seeking to gain more information about maternal health, or just have a general interest in working collaboratively, I am here to help.

## Who can I contact>
If you want to report a problem or suggest an enhancement I'd love for you to open an issue or contact me on Twitter @necharism.

## Thank You
Without you, this project would not succeed so I wanted to thank all contributors who are helping to make maternal healthcare more equitable.
